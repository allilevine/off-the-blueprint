  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Here's all the gear that's currently in my bag, with some notes about items I've retired.</p>

<h2>Electronic Gear</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/01-IMG_2212-1024x768.jpg" alt="Minimalist Packing List Electronics - Off the Blueprint" /></p>

<h3>Laptop</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.refurb.me" target="_blank">Refurbished</a> 13” macbook air with 8 gb ram and 128 gb of storage, which I’ve supplemented with a 128 gb sd card and a 64 gb micro usb stick. It's in a slim hard case. I cut down my old PackTowl to match the shape of my laptop and I leave it in to keep keyboard dirt off the screen.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span>Retired:</span> Samsung Go netbook with Ubuntu installed.</p>

<h3>Laptop Software</h3>
<p>I back my air up to the cloud with <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/" target="_blank">BackBlaze</a> and use a VPN, <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/" target="_blank">Private Internet Access</a>. I use <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/" target="_blank">Alfred</a>, which helps reduce the need to click.</p>

<h3>Laptop Peripherals</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.therooststand.com/" target="_blank">The Roost</a> and a USB Apple keyboard I "borrowed" from a family member.</p>

<h3>Phone</h3>
<p>iPhone 5c I bought on eBay. I have a T-Mobile sim and their $20/month "Simple Choice" international data roaming plan.</p>

<h3>Headphones</h3>
<p>$30 bluetooth over-ear headset that’s great when it actually works. I'd love to find something better and more packable, but I'm not sure I use it enough to justify an expensive alternative. I also have the headphones that came with the iPhone for when I can't be bothered.</p>

<h3>Assorted cords and batteries</h3>
<p>Laptop power cord (the two-pronged half, not the heavy three-prong extension cord), phone power cord, travel adapter, a mini display port to HDMI / VGA converter. Also an external battery for recharging my phone on the road with cord.</p>

<h2>Clothing</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/03-IMG_2236-1024x768.jpg" alt="Minimalist Packing List Clothing - Off the Blueprint" /></p>

<h3>Travel Pants</h3>
<p>Athleta Metro High Waisted Leggings, which were recommended by <a href="http://www.makingitanywhere.com/2015-digital-nomad-packing-list/" target="_blank">Making it Anywhere</a>. They're comfy and actually have tiny pockets, and are very affordable on sale. My second bottoms are an old pair of merino blend long underwear from Costco that I sleep in.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span>Retired:</span> Anatomie Skinny Skyler Pants. They lasted a while but eventually looked pretty awful, maybe because I wore the crap out of them. Also: REI travel pants that looked awful to begin with, and Icebreaker Villa pants that developed holes. I also left my Toad & Co ribbed leap leggings behind because they took up too much room and didn't hold their shape very well.</p>

<h3>Shirts</h3>
<p>Nau M2 sleeveless top, Nau M2 henley, and Icebreaker Everyday cami. The cami has developed a small hole.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span>Retired:</span> Icebreaker shirts that never got holes, but were either accidentally shrunk in the dryer or wore out.</p>

<h3>Mid-layer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.eu.lululemon.com/products/clothes-accessories/view-all-women-tops/Rest-Less-Pullover?cc=12466&skuId=uk_3649790" target="_blank">Lululemon Rest Less Pullover</a>. I really wanted the hoodie but they don't seem to sell that version in Europe.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span>Retired:</span> Ibex Shak Lite Hoodie, which was AWESOME because of the pockets and hood but developed holes before I'd even worn it a year. Also the Icebreaker Bliss Wrap, which just wasn't useful enough and took up too much room. Before those I traveled with a Patagonia cashmere cardigan that was nice but got holey fast. And I have a tendency to let holes get too big to repair...</p>

<h3>Underwear</h3>
<p>3 pairs of Patagonia barely hipster underwear, 2 of which have lasted for over 4 years. Also a Patagonia barely bra and an Ibex bralette, which have seen better days.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span>Retired:</span> Icebreaker siren bra, which stretched out really fast and didn't offer much coverage.</p>

<h3>Socks</h3>
<p>One pair Smartwool no-show socks and one pair Vermont Darn Tough socks.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span>Retired:</span> Icebreaker socks that turned gross from the inside of my shoes and Smartwool walking socks that developed holes at the backs of my ankles.</p>

<h3>Shoes</h3>
<p>Vivobarefoot Gwens and Vivobarefoot Jing Jings. Neither seem very durable but they have great barefoot feel and I like how they look...when not covered in mud.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span>Retired:</span> My DIY Xero shoes, which were just too much of a pain to get right and take on and off. Also my Soft Star Runamocs and Ramblers, which were great shoes but just not for me.</p>

<h3>Rain Jacket</h3>
<p>Outdoor Research Aspire Jacket, which offers the best rain protection I have ever owned. It's overkill for most places though, so next time I'd go with something lighter.</p>

<h3>Soft Shell</h3>
<p>I traveled for six months with just my wool hoodie and my rain jacket, but I decided I should probably get something heavier for New York and the UK in winter. Nau was having a sale and I couldn't resist their wool Transporter jacket, which has 0 packability but excellent pockets and oh so much high-collar class.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span>Retired:</span> My REI revelcloud synthetic down jacket, which I wore to bits.</p>

<h3>Accessories</h3>
<p>Just my Toad & Co infinity scarf. It wasn't super warm in the cold but it was enough with the two jackets.</p>

<h2>Toiletries</h2>

<p><a href="http://offtheblueprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/05-IMG_2253.jpg"><img src="/assets/05-IMG_2253-1024x768.jpg" alt="Minimalist Packing List Cosmetics - Off the Blueprint" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>$6 electric toothbrush with a removable head and replacement heads</li>
<li>2oz bottle of unscented Dr. Bronner's</li>
<li>Meow Meow Tweet solid beer shampoo in a Lush tin</li>
<li>Lush solid deodorant</li>
<li>Lunette menstrual cup</li>
<li>2 reusable pads (one is an ingenious two-use foldable pad with liner from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/MonoMio" target="_blank">MonoMio Etsy Shop</a>)</li>
<li>Travel-sized tube of toothpaste</li>
<li>Floss</li>
<li>2 oz Nalgene bottle I refill with mouthwash when in transit</li>
<li>Electric razor I'm trying out</li>
<li>Regular razor with disposable head</li>
<li>Travel hairbrush with hair things</li>
<li>Chapstick</li>
</ul>

<h2>Everything Else</h2>
<p>Tom Bihn Side Effect, mesh bags, keyboard bag that's too big for the keyboard, loksak passport-sized bag, field notes, business cards, pen with ink refills, plastic fork and spoon, spare pair of glasses, Vapur bottle, wallet, change purse, passport</p>

<p class="footnote"><span>Retired:</span> Tom Bihn Travel Tray (I miss it but it was overkill for my packing style), head lamp, Grayl water bottle with tap filter (kept leaking on plane trips, even after they sent me new lids)</p>

<h2>Backpack</h2>
<p>I carry Tom Bihn's <a href="http://www.tombihn.com/PROD/TB0110.html" target="_blank">Synapse 19</a>.

<h2>How I Pack Everything</h2>
<p>I pack my laptop in the inner sleeve pocket of the Synapse. I pack my clothing in a mesh bag, my rain jacket by itself, and anything I'll need in-flight / in-train in the Side Effect. I also pack my bag of docs (with keyboard), my Jing Jings, and the Roost in the largest pocket of the Synapse. My cosmetics go in the bottom pocket and everything else fits in the sides. The Vapur bottle (if filled with water) and any other toiletries or snacks go in the water bottle pocket.</p>
